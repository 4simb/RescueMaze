 * @brief An abstraction for Arduino.hpp
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2021-05-30
 * 
 * @copyright Copyright (c) 2021
 * 
 * @details
 *  This header provides implementation for the arduino platform.
 *  It should provide everything you expect from an Arduino.h header
 *  but is independent of the development board.
 *  This header also defines a variable called ABSTRATION_PLATFORM, which allows
 *  for platform specific implementations.
 * 
 *  The following platforms are supported at the moment:
 *  0 or ndef -> not a supported platform
 *  1 -> Arduino (use the real Arduino.h)
 *  2 -> RaspberryPI (based on ArduinoRaspi)
 * 
 *  100 -> ArduinoFake (use this for unit testing)
 * 
 * @warning This is not a portable header file and works differently for
 *  each development board. Make sure not to link against the wrong board.
